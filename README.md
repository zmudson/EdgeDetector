# Edge Detecting app for Hackaton

In the console give the path to the image, and then it will generate the image with detected edges.

The source code is made as IntelliJ project. You can use the executable Detector.jar to test it:
``` java -jar Detector.jar ```

When the program ask you to give the filename, give the relative path to the image f.e. Put the file (f.e. image.png) in the same directory as the executable and then give the name of this file (image.png).
